### üîí Developer Security Notes

**deleteAccount() Supabase Admin Warning**

- The `deleteAccount()` function requires **Supabase Admin API privileges**.  
- In production, using the **anon key** will cause this operation to fail because it lacks admin permissions.  
- For production environments, this should be implemented via a **Supabase Edge Function proxy** to securely authorize account deletion.  
- This direct `admin.deleteUser()` call is **safe for development/testing only** but **not suitable for production release**.  
- Before TestFlight submission, ensure this limitation is clearly documented and a secure alternative is planned.

### üí° Adapty Integration Timing Note

Adapty integration will be postponed until after the first App Store review to avoid potential rejections caused by third-party payment SDKs.

**Plan:**
- **Initial submission (v1.0):** Use a manual (dummy) paywall with ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù button only.
- **Post-approval update (v1.1):** Implement AdaptyService.swift and enable real subscription management flow.

This approach shortens the review process and ensures compliance with App Store payment guidelines for the first release.

## Phase 10 ‚Äì Success Metrics & Continuous Improvement
- [ ] 10,000 downloads in 30 days
- [ ] 40%+ Day 7 retention
- [ ] 15%+ social share rate
- [ ] 5%+ free-to-paid conversion
- [ ] App Store rating > 4.5
- [ ] Crash rate < 0.1%
- [ ] App launch time < 3s
- [ ] API response time < 500ms
- [x] Start with one screen, make it perfect
- [x] Use Cursor AI for rapid prototyping
- [ ] Iterate based on user feedback
- [x] Don't over-engineer early features
- [x] Focus on core user journey first
