# Onboarding Diagnostic Logs - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **Diagnostic Logging Implemented**

---

## Changes Made

### 1. BirthInfoModalView.swift

Added comprehensive logging throughout the `saveBirthInfo()` function:

**Line 148-152:** Initial data logging
```swift
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] Save button tapped")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] Birth date: \(birthDate)")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] Birth time: \(birthTime)")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] Birth city: \(birthCity)")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] Birth country: \(birthCountry)")
```

**Line 154-158:** User ID validation
```swift
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ ERROR: currentUserId is nil")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] Current user ID from authService: \(authService.currentUserId ?? "nil")")
```

**Line 162-163:** Success path
```swift
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ✅ Got user ID: \(userId)")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] Mode: Guest or Authenticated")
```

**Line 169:** Step-by-step tracking
```swift
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] [STEP 1/4] Starting save process")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] [STEP 2/4] Sending birth details to Supabase")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] [STEP 3/4] Marking onboarding as complete")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ✅ [STEP 4/4] All updates completed successfully")
```

**Line 231-239:** Error logging
```swift
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ ERROR occurred during save")
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ Error type:", type(of: error))
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ Error description:", error.localizedDescription)
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ Error domain:", nsError.domain)
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ Error code:", nsError.code)
print("🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ Error userInfo:", nsError.userInfo)
```

### 2. AuthService.swift

Enhanced `currentUserId` property with logging and guest support:

**Lines 53-55:** Supabase client check
```swift
print("🧩 [AUTH] currentUserId: Supabase client not available")
```

**Lines 58-64:** Guest user fallback
```swift
print("🧩 [AUTH] currentUserId: No authenticated user")
// Check for guest user_id
let guestUserId = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "guest_user_id")
print("🧩 [AUTH] currentUserId: Guest user_id from UserDefaults: \(guestUserId ?? "nil")")
return guestUserId
```

**Lines 67-69:** Authenticated user
```swift
print("🧩 [AUTH] currentUserId: Authenticated user ID: \(userId)")
```

---

## What These Logs Will Reveal

### Scenario 1: Missing user_id (Guest mode issue)
**If you see:**
```
🧩 [AUTH] currentUserId: No authenticated user
🧩 [AUTH] currentUserId: Guest user_id from UserDefaults: nil
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ ERROR: currentUserId is nil
```
**Diagnosis:** Guest user not created yet. Need to call `create_guest_user()` first.

### Scenario 2: Database permission issue (RLS blocking)
**If you see:**
```
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ✅ Got user ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
🧩 [ONBOARDING] [STEP 2/4] Sending birth details to Supabase
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ ERROR: insert or update on table "users" violates foreign key constraint
```
**Diagnosis:** RLS policy blocking update. Need to use `SECURITY DEFINER` function or service role key.

### Scenario 3: Invalid payload
**If you see:**
```
🧩 [ONBOARDING] [STEP 2/4] Payload: ["birth_date": "...", ...]
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ ERROR: Invalid column name
```
**Diagnosis:** Database schema mismatch (column names wrong).

### Scenario 4: Network error
**If you see:**
```
🧩 [ONBOARDING] [STEP 2/4] Sending birth details to Supabase
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ❌ ERROR: Network request failed
```
**Diagnosis:** Connectivity or Supabase configuration issue.

### Scenario 5: Success
**If you see:**
```
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ✅ Got user ID: <uuid>
🧩 [ONBOARDING] [STEP 2/4] Sending birth details to Supabase
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ✅ [STEP 2/4] Birth details saved successfully
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ✅ [STEP 3/4] Onboarding marked as complete
🧩 [ONBOARDING] ✅ [STEP 4/4] All updates completed successfully
```
**Diagnosis:** Everything works! ✅

---

## Build Status

✅ **BUILD SUCCEEDED**
- All diagnostic logs added
- No compilation errors
- Ready for testing

---

## Next Steps

1. **Launch the app** in iOS Simulator
2. **Attempt guest onboarding**
3. **Collect console logs** starting with "🧩 [ONBOARDING]" or "🧩 [AUTH]"
4. **Share the logs** to identify the root cause

The diagnostic logs will pinpoint exactly where the failure occurs:
- Before user_id retrieval
- During Supabase update call
- Database permission error
- Network issue
- Payload format issue

---

## What Was NOT Changed

- ❌ Network request logic (same Supabase calls)
- ❌ Database structure
- ❌ Update payload format
- ❌ Error handling behavior

Only **diagnostic logging** was added to collect information.
